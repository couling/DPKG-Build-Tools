# This file is used by the package-project script in the 
# DpkgBuildTools project to build a build a dpkg-pakage from this project
#
# This quite simply lists which files from this project to put where.
# Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' are ignored as comments and
# white space. 
#
# Instructional lines are formed of three sections separated by colons ':'.
#
# action:source:target
# - action currently supports "file" and "link"
# - the source for a link must be a file relative to a file on the target system, this may be 
#   a file provided by the project or one expected to exist already on the target system
# - the source for a file must be a file provided by the project being packaged
# - the target for a link and a file must be a be a location relative to the root of the target system.
#   The target must NOT have a leading slash, it must be considered a relative path relative to the root.
