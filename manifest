# This file is used by the package-project script in the 
# DpkgBuildTools project to build a build a dpkg package from this project
#
# This quite simply lists which files from this project to put where.
# Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' are ignored as comments and
# white space. The special folder DEBIAN is used by dpkg-deb automatically 
# to control the project.
#
# Instructional lines are formed of four sections separated by colons ':'.
#
# action:source:target:file-mode
# - action 
#   currently supports "file", "dir", "link", control and source
#       file adds a file from the project to the target system (dirs are created automatically).
#       dir creates an empty dir and or changes it's mode.
#       link creates a symbolic link on the target system.
#
# - source 
#       ink: must be a file relative to a file on the target system, this may be 
#           a file provided by the project or one expected to exist already on the target system
#       file: must be a file provided by the project being packaged
#       dir: file is ignored.
# - target: must be a be a location RELATIVE to the root of the target system.
#       This MUST NOT have a leading slash.
# - control: copies a file to DEBIAN/control. If SVN in installed and the current source file in 
#       a working copy, the revision number will be appended to the version number. Also the size
#       will be replaced by the actual size
# - source: changes the current working directory from this point forward in the file.
#       This is very helpful when the manifest exists in a subdirectory of the project.
#       The path is always relative to the manifest file.
